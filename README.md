Debug Console
============

An advanced directx debugging solution as replacement for debugscript.
It replaces the old debugscript chat with a moveable multi-tab window.
This resource will make code debugging much easier, because you can
route your debug message to a personal tab and it won't be mixed together
with all the other debug messages.

Information
============

This is the development branch. This means you probably won't be able to run this code
properly or it may change dramatically in structure. It's not meant to be used on a
public server.
