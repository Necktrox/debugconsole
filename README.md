Debug Console
============

An advanced directx debugging solution as replacement for debugscript.
It replaces the old debugscript chat with a moveable multi-tab window.
This resource will make code debugging much easier, because you can
route your debug message to a personal tab and it won't be mixed together
with all the other debug messages.

Development
============

The resource is right now under huge refactoring to improve the readability
and to structure the code into multiple files. Code duplicates will be
removed where it's possible.
